      <description>And so the best of 2024 lingers into the new year. &lt;em&gt;Anora (2024)&lt;/em&gt; leaves me with an intangible feeling, one that strikes an emotional core like no other feminist-adjacent media has done in recent memory. i feel something fundamentally true to the feminine condition in Mikey Madisons performance as Anora. and i cant unfeel it, despite the months that go by since seeing this movie&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I am sitting in a forest inside a botanic garden, where everything is in bloom. the last of summer lies ahead. today, the greenhouses were open to the public and all the flower beds seem to glisten, bathing in light and sugar water.  and then it occurs to me that late August captures the precise seasonality of the album (Maude Latours debut Sugar Water)&amp;hellip;.</description>
