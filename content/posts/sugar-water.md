I am sitting in a forest inside a botanic garden, where everything is in bloom. the last of summer lies ahead. today, the greenhouses were open to the public and all the flower beds seem to glisten, bathing in light and sugar water. 

*Sugar water* is Maude Latour's debut album. she’s airy, pop rising, floating light among mere mortals. and then it occurs to me that late August captures the precise seasonality of the album. well, i think the language of the album is this. *sugar water* marks the end of the summer as the end of the world.

`'I had a vision of the north star.'`

The starting line of a song (track 9). i can’t help but feel a fever for Perseid’s meteor showers, how my friends used to go to this hill in arlington in August to watch the stars peel off the sky, shooting fire, don’t blink and you’ll miss it. and i do miss it. the north star is from a ditty called cosmic superstar girl om *sugar water*'s back half.

`'You are a party, you are a wave, you are a magical skateboard rider, you are a rave.'`

Bloom is the last song (track 12). from a buddhist spiritualist standpoint, the effect of listening is circular, party to rave. The song is ridiculous although it's not. for everything must run its course. in death, love is displaced, as matter is transformed and never created nor destroyed. the love that existed then persists in a new form, and then... you bloom. in the last segment of the project, Maude puts forth this call to action. 

Of course there are moments throughout listening where she's telling me i'm already dead. so i'm dying, i'm dead, and i’m entering the whirpool (track 4), going down the drain, losening my grip. maude is having me skate rock bottom. 

But then again, our minds are sinking ships amongst waves and pathways and scripture and the beds of gleaming flowers and isn't that as crazy as seeing infinite roses on ketamine (track 11). my brain breaks this down: *sugar water* is a code for late august, saturation. maximal life energy bursting its container. she follows through on her concepts, to the effect that the throughline is kaleidoscopic, fatal. 

`'You are the last dance, and baby you're god'`

She's praising nature's perfect math and beauty everywhere you look. inside the botanic garden and everything blooms. i feel enveloped, sensing the spirals of golden ratios embedded in the shape of tree leaves. repeating themselves on fractal scales. resembling a pattern that disappears as fast as it came. so sweet, that even pain illuminates. she's telling me i'm high on sugar water: it's not what i expect of a debut pop record but i will embrace it. i'm sure August has found its soundwave.


 *( Tough cookie critics have, in the past, challenged Maude's use of a Lorde-like style of singing and lyric writing that can veer closer to clumsiness than specifity (example: 'cause im slipping through the cracks of the floorboards to the apartment below us, yeah'). with this latest entry, does she outgrow her borders and into a league of her own? she claims existential pop, which i find fitting. it's fitting that her poptimism is charting in August, a project of hundreds of songs thoughtfully filtered down to 12. )*
