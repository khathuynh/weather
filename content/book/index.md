**I've been working on a novel over the past year (magical realism, ecological fiction) with aims to publish in Spring 2025.**

The story follows two friends reconnecting in their hometown, taking place over 24 hours. Their friendship is fraught. It is intergenerational. It is a first love. Above all, it is rooted in the built environment.

The throughline is tightly wound to **spirit of place**: reverent appreciation for literature/film tradition, schools of thought, and cultural production tied to a geographic or regional specificity.

Locality: Our two friends roam Sommerford-Camberville; almost all of the book’s events take place there. Their fictional journey is concretely grounded in the historic legacy of **Boston’s streetcar neighborhoods**.

The book hopes to inspire readers to more deeply identify with their personal history and hometown communities across the US. A belief central to the book universe is that there are more stories to be told… beyond those set squarely in the media powerhouses of NYC and LA, in the uninspired critiques of a homogenized suburbia, and in the declension narrative of gentrification.

On a thematic level, the book considers the seemingly inevitable way that time transforms the world until it is unrecognizable to the people who have endured it. Worlds fading, one into the next. The friends experience nostalgia as a spiritual possession: a desire to possess the past of memory, as well as the images of the future they had previously held.
 
In the end, the friends question what is meant by a borrowed life, and the natural and unnatural forces of dispossession. They muse over ownership of past selves among friendship. Finding your place is important. Why does it feel like for half our lives we search for this feeling, and by the end long to see it how it was before? But the coming of ages can't be stopped; it'll come and go just the same. 

**The neighborhood is always changing.**
