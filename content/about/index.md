<!-- when i am not making muffins, or napping, i respond to the weather system i live inside.  -->

<!-- this is my platform to forecast weather that has mostly already happened. but. time to a cat is no real matter- for i have all the time in the world! and, to boot, a sixth sense for the mystery of mother nature. -->
